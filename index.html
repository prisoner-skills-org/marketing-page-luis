        <div class='mission'>
            <p>This app allows prison management to broadcast the skill of inmates to make better use of their time
                using their skills to make a wage and becoming more employable after prison.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='information'>
            <p>
                This app contains two user types. You can use it as a prison admin or as a single user who can view
                posted profiles by prison. Prison admins are able to log in and create profiles for their inmates. The
                ability to view profiles created by prison administrators is aimed at single users who are potential
                employers.
            </p>
            <p>
                For potential employer - No log in needed. You get access to a list of prisons who have posted
                prisoner profiles. In this list you can see how many profiles each prison has listed and where the prison 
                is located. Clicking on a prison takes you to the profile pages of the prisoners.
            </p>
            <p>
                For prison admins - After an admin logs in, they are directed to a page where they can see the people’s
                profiles they’ve created in a list view. In this list they have the possibility to edit the created profiles
                and they have the option to create new ones.
